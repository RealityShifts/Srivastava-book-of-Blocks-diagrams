# Architecture diagrams

One Mermaid `flowchart TD` per public block, organised by category. The
specs live in [`_generate.py`](./_generate.py); regenerate everything with

```bash
python _generate.py
```

## Where these render

| Tool | What to do |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **GitHub** | Renders the `.md` files inline — just open them in the browser. |
| **draw.io / diagrams.net** | *Arrange → Insert → Advanced → Mermaid*, paste the fenced block. |
| **Excalidraw** | *Library → Mermaid to Excalidraw*, paste the fenced block. |
| **Notion / Obsidian / GitLab / VS Code** | Native Mermaid in markdown preview. |
| **Standalone SVG** | `npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i path/to/Block.md -o Block.svg` |

## Recommended diagramming tools (alternatives to draw.io)

* **Excalidraw** — beautiful hand-drawn look, exports SVG, supports Mermaid import.
* **D2** (`d2lang.com`) — declarative, very clean output, good for hierarchies.
* **Mermaid Live Editor** (`mermaid.live`) — paste & download SVG/PNG.
* **TikZ / PGF** — gold standard for paper-quality figures (LaTeX).
* **PlotNeuralNet** — tex-based 3-D blocks for deep nets.
* **NN-SVG** — quick SVGs for classic CNN / FCN / LeNet shapes.
* **Penrose** — declarative diagram constraints if you need bespoke layouts.

## Color legend

| Class | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `io`     | Inputs and outputs |
| `op`     | Generic differentiable op (matmul, conv, …) |
| `norm`   | Normalisation layers |
| `act`    | Activation functions |
| `attn`   | Attention operators |
| `merge`  | Sum / concat / element-wise combine |
| `emb`    | Embedding tables / encoded representations |
| `loss`   | Loss / objective |
| `ctrl`   | Control / non-differentiable flow |
| `ref`    | Reference to another block (expanded as a subgraph) |

Dashed arrows (`-. skip .->`) mark residual / skip connections.

## Recursive expansion

Specs may use `_ref("BlockName")` to point at another registered block.
Run `python _generate.py --depth N` to inline references up to `N` levels
deep as nested Mermaid `subgraph` blocks (default: 1). At depth 0 each
ref renders as a single `ref`-styled box; cycles are detected and broken.
